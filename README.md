# AIML-Berk
Completed analysis of the dataset containing Coupon data along with customer driving data. The goal is to answer the question "Will the customer accept the coupon". Initial analysis was done on the "Bar" coupon and it was found that acceptance is heavily influenced by how often the customer frequents a bar.
Independent analysis was then carried out on the Coffee House coupon. The final conclusion was that if the coupon had a long expiry and was given to driver who frequents a coffee house more than 3 times a month and was given at 10 AM in the morning, it is almost guaranteed to be accepted.
